# Peer_To_Peer_Blog

A user-hosted peer-to-peer blogging and communication platform with open-source back-end and front-end systems and public API's


## GOAL

1. To build a supernet, alternative to the current moderated/censored Internet.
2. To compile Web3.0 into a cohesive accessible package for mass adoption and ease-of-use.
3. Give everyone responsibility/authority over their data, and a low-bar entrypoint into a functionally/purposely designed digital economy
4. A true and dependable alternative to the current Dollar-mediated economy (and its tendency towards inflation and self-destructive capital operations)

### MEANS:

    1. A true P2P information system, a truly/globally distributed massively parrallel server system without central nodes (points of failure/control) - to integrate a min. set of protocols and systems for both anonymity, privacy, and redundancy. => the idea is for everyone to be their own server/host, and freely transact their own personal information and control the presentation of themselves to the world, and act as a router/sub-host to maintain accessibility for others (basically an opt-in super-botnet)

2. a superSocial app, that bypasses the centralisation of current social media, but allowing a base API and opensource framework: for anyone to be able => a 'facebook/twitter/reddit/discord/twitch/youtube' super-app, with the account holder acting as their own server/host/moderator/censor -> and to be able to control where the data is and who has access to it, and the lifetime of that data
3. A superCoin app, a digital wallet/system that allows one to transact conveniently - and without risk of control/limitation; but not just a wallet, but a personal bank app, to act as an Non-Fungible Token economy where real and digital assets can be independently/anonymously owned and operated -> basically both wallet and balance sheet, and personnal accounting app : to reduce the abstraction as much as possible, and a personal ledger for transaction history
   1. PeerToPeer Lending scheme -> bypass the predatory loan/credit systems, and a smart contract Credit Rating System, and an in-built cash-recovery/bankruptcy recovery system -> assume new money enters the system, but is accompanied by new demand, enforce an anti-inflation system
   2. true logical limit/application of micro-transactions, accompanied by the balance sheet system to ensure credibility: we'll help you make good decisions, but not stupid ones -> debase the community from a purely debit/balance economy (at the start), to a semi-pure credit economy (loans/debts on balance sheet), but without the middleman (banks and govs)
4. a superInvestment: by allowing the users/members, to offer their own device(s) or skill(s) as a base feature - 'Fiverr/Amazon/Ebay' combined with renting out device storage/processing capacity
   1. -> the VPN supernet also allows an account holder to create their own VPN subnet to connect their own devices (can use hosting on PC for storage server, and phone for social media and data control) => true anonymity in that don't know what data is hosted, from whom specifically, and users; however smart contracts allow you to ensure profitability/income from work/service offered
   2. remove entry-barrier by embedding Scripting and rapid-Prototyping systems, allowing anyone with coding skills and good ideas to be able to create solutions/ideas and spread/test them at scale rapidly (ie Roblox/Epic without the gatekeeping),
   3. integration with superCoin features, allows embedding eCommerce/microTransaction features, but with full transparency of cashflow
5. a superOrg -decentralised corporations system :-> the largest bottleneck for organisations, is communication and orderly organisation, I.T has the unique ability to reduce the overhead of communication and base information collection and processing;
   1. govs (at large and small scales) can rapidly collect and disseminate info to the populace within an area, eg true Democracy with micro polls and anonymous feedback
   2. or true e-Citizenship where one can manage responsibilities freely in any physical jurisdiction by e-ID, and therefore fulfill civic duties specifically for services they need (ie, a government or nation is a physical corp with an online identity with public infrastructure as its assets and its services as liabilities: e-transactions/identity allows the government to be able to better offer services, but a public log page allows deeper scrutiny of its transactions/behaviours ie transparency)
   3. public companies -> a private corp that goes public for financing and to sell assets, have a transparent accounts log to avoid/prevent fraud,
   4. anonymous individuals organising privately on large projects mediated by the superSocial and superCoin systems, using the decentralised Org structure to keep accountability (basically an anonymous git)


### Disclaimers:

1. It is impossible to prevent nefarious/evil/illegal use of the technolog(y/ies) and/or systems.
2. It is impossible to ensure 100% anonymity, privacy, or redundancy/availability.
3. It is unnecessary to create 100% applicable and useful system, just good enough with enough functionality to onboard others and equip them with problem solving skills.
4. The core focus, is P2P Information system, with security, privacy and anonymity applications: superSocial, superCoin, superOrg are subsets (and applications), offering a stable/uniform/standardised API for others to build their solutions around it


## Components

These are the subset of components for the system to function

### System Description

A massively parrallel superdistributed, virtual proxy network, built in evented microservice architecture.

Applications: superCoin (personal virtual banking), superSocial (personal information/publicity control), superOrg (decentralised organisation)

### Minimum System Subcomponents

1. Virtual Proxy Network
   1. WWW-net VPN, superOrg-modifiable VPN overlay)
2. Peer-to-Peer File Transfer NetworK
   1. Network support server (P2P Leecher, Onion/VPN trampoline),
   2. User facing server (mail server, ftp server, media streaming server, VOIP server)
3. Opensource InMemory Evented (scriptable) DBMS
   1. backbone for apps, capable of multiple simultaneous DBs
4. Scripting-Processing API
   1. allow easy modification/prototyping/development
   2. easy bug-fixing/utility-creation
5. Application layer:
   1. superSocial, (user-hosted/proxy-hosted network -> discord/facebook/whatsapp/IG/youtube superapp)
   2. superCoin, (multi-currency anonymous wallet, (NFT) Balance Sheet, Transaction Ledger systems)
   3. superInvestment (P2P Lending -> interest-free banking, smart-contract credit system)
   4. superOrg (polling, timetabling, communicands,)

## Conclusion

The final goal, of all these subsytems, is to build a stable/consistent API and kernel, and a ruleset for creating API's to allow this kernel to be extended and built upon by other individuals.

### The Enemy

Individuals who seek to control the masses, by coercion and segregation and lies

### The Goal

To conquer the stars
